### Planning Story
Approaching this project, I need to use my new learned knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS and jQuery to make a Single Page Application variant of Tic Tac Toe. The game is simple in theory, but will prove to be a challenge from a development standpoint. I need to start with what my game's actions will be and what the response of the API is going to be. After I have an idea of what I want the project to look like, I can start getting a visual representation by making some wireframes.

### User Stories
